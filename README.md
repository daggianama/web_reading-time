# web_reading-time
Chrome extension to show reading time⌛️ of webpages text.<br>
It was created by customizing of tutorial Chrome extension "reading time" created by Google.

# features
Open to read data in all URLs.
Changed to search inside the web body and not the article tag as it was originally created.
I added green background for a better user experience and relative font size.
